# Mixed Motion rPPG Video Dataset

This dataset contains videos captured under mixed motion scenarios, including stationary, walking, and running activities, designed for research on remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). The videos are suitable for evaluating rPPG signal extraction methods, heart rate estimation, and activity classification in varying motion contexts.

## Dataset Overview

- **Content**: Each video includes a combination of different motions:
  - Stationary
  - Walking
  - Running
- **Video Format**: AVI
- **Resolution**: 1280x720
- **Frame Rate**: 30 FPS
- **Annotation**: The dataset includes synchronized rPPG signals, derived from videos with corresponding ground truth heart rate data.

## Usage Policy

This dataset is intended for research purposes only, specifically for the evaluation of rPPG algorithms in mixed motion contexts. Users are required to submit a request form to access the dataset, providing a brief description of their intended research.
